# The Original Project
## General Description
As a part of the same repository, two unrelated networking tools and two related networking exploits were implemented as an assignment for the Networking course of the University of Bucharest. All of these implementations rely heavily on `scapy`, the packet manipulation package.

## Networking Tools
### Traceroute
While similar to the majority of `traceroute` utilities, this UDP implementation also specifies details such as the country, the region and the city of each host, using the `ipinfo.io` API.

### Ad blocking DNS resolver

## Networking Exploits
The desired architecture on which the exploits are designed to run is described below from a networking perspective.
